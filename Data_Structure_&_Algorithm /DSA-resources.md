This file contains essential resources, tutorials, and reference materials to understand and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## ðŸ“š **What is DSA?**
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the building blocks of software development.  
- **Data Structures**: Organize and store data efficiently for easy access and modification.  
- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems.  

---

## ðŸ“˜ **Important Data Structures**
1. **Arrays**  
   - Fixed-size container to store elements of the same type.  
   - **Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Traversing.  

2. **Linked List**  
   - A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.  
   - Types: **Singly**, **Doubly**, and **Circular** Linked Lists.  

3. **Stack**  
   - **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** structure.  
   - Used in recursion, backtracking, and undo/redo operations.  

4. **Queue**  
   - **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** structure.  
   - Types: **Simple Queue**, **Circular Queue**, **Priority Queue**, **Deque**.  

5. **Hashing**  
   - Maps keys to values using hash functions.  
   - Used for fast lookup, like in hash tables and dictionaries.  

6. **Trees**  
   - Hierarchical data structure with **root**, **nodes**, and **children**.  
   - Types: **Binary Tree**, **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, **AVL Tree**, **Heap**, etc.  

7. **Graphs**  
   - Consists of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges**.  
   - Types: **Directed** and **Undirected** Graphs.  
   - Represented using **adjacency matrix** or **adjacency list**.

## ðŸ“˜ **Important Algorithms**
1. **Searching Algorithms**  
   - **Linear Search**: Simple but slow.  
   - **Binary Search**: Efficient for sorted arrays.  

2. **Sorting Algorithms**  
   - **Bubble Sort**: Compare and swap adjacent elements.  
   - **Selection Sort**: Select the minimum element for each pass.  
   - **Insertion Sort**: Insert elements in their correct position.  
   - **Merge Sort**: Divide and Conquer approach for efficient sorting.  
   - **Quick Sort**: Uses a pivot to partition the array and recursively sorts subarrays.  

3. **Recursion**  
   - A function that calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.  
   - Used in divide-and-conquer algorithms (like Merge Sort, Quick Sort).  

4. **Greedy Algorithms**  
   - Makes the locally optimal choice at each step.  
   - Examples: **Huffman Encoding**, **Primâ€™s Algorithm**, **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**.  

5. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
   - Breaks down a problem into overlapping subproblems and stores results.  
   - Examples: **Fibonacci sequence**, **Knapsack problem**, **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**.  

6. **Backtracking**  
   - Tries out all possibilities and backtracks when a solution fails.  
   - Used in **N-Queens Problem**, **Sudoku Solver**, and **Maze Solving**.  

7. **Graph Algorithms**  
   - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Level-wise traversal of a graph.  
   - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores as far as possible along each path.  
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path in weighted graphs.  
   - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest path algorithm.  

8. **Divide and Conquer**  
   - Divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them, and combines the results.  
   - Examples: **Merge Sort**, **Binary Search**, **Quick Sort**.
