# ðŸ“˜ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Resources

This file contains essential resources, tutorials, and reference materials to understand OOP concepts in C++.

## ðŸ“š **What is OOP?**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects and classes. The four main principles of OOP are:  
- **Encapsulation**: Grouping related data and functions together while restricting access to certain details.  
- **Abstraction**: Exposing only essential features while hiding the complex internal logic.  
- **Inheritance**: Reusing existing code by creating new classes from existing ones.  
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing functions to behave differently based on the object calling them.

## ðŸ“˜ **OOP Concepts**
1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - Class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of a class.  
   - Classes contain attributes (variables) and methods (functions).  

2. **Encapsulation**  
   - Hides internal data from outside interference and only exposes what is necessary.  
   - Achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `public`, and `protected`.  

3. **Inheritance**  
   - Enables the creation of new classes from existing ones (base class â†’ derived class).  
   - Promotes reusability and hierarchy in OOP design.  

4. **Polymorphism**  
   - **Compile-time polymorphism**: Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.  
   - **Runtime polymorphism**: Achieved through inheritance and virtual functions.  

5. **Abstraction**  
   - Focus on "what an object does" rather than "how it does it".  
   - Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
